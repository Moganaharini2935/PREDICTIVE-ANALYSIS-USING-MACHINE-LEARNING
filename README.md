NAME : MOGANA HARINI U

DOMAIN : Machine Learning with Predictive Analysis

DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK 2 : "Predictive analysis using machine learning" is performed in this project to detect signs of digital fatigue based on user behavior and system usage data.The workflow begins with importing essential libraries and loading the dataset, followed by data cleaning steps such as removing missing values and duplicates to ensure the integrity of the data. "Feature selection" is performed to include relevant variables like screen time, stress level, workload score, and software usage patterns, which are critical for fatigue prediction. Categorical variables are encoded to prepare the data for model training.

The selected features are split into training and testing sets, and standardization is applied to normalize the inputs. A "Random Forest Classifier" is used as the primary model to classify user conditions as either "fatigued or not fatigued" based on behavioral indicators. Predictions from the model are used to simulate a real-world scenario, a smart alert system is implemented. If the model detects fatigue in a user, an alert is generated recommending the user to take a break. Otherwise, the system advises them to continue working. This adds a practical, user-focused application to the predictive model.

In addition to model training and prediction, the project includes comprehensive evaluation and visualization.This workflow effectively demonstrates the complete machine learning process feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation fulfilling the core objectives of predictive analysis using classification techniques.
